Next-generation seaborn interface
=================================

Over the past year, I have been developing an entirely new interface for
making plots with seaborn. The new interface is designed to be
declarative, compositional and extensible. If successful, it will both
greatly expand the space of plots that can be created with seaborn while
making the experience of doing so simpler and more delightful.

To make that concrete, here is how you make a `hello world
example <http://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html#our-first-seaborn-plot>`__
with the new interface:

.. code:: ipython3

    import seaborn as sns
    sns.set_theme()
    tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
    
    import seaborn.objects as so
    (
        so.Plot(
            tips, "total_bill", "tip",
            color="smoker", marker="smoker", pointsize="size",
        )
        .facet("time")
        .add(so.Scatter())
        .configure(figsize=(7, 4))
    )

Installing the alpha
--------------------

If you’re interested, please install the alpha and kick the tires.
Expect some rough edges and some instability! But feedback will be very
helpful in pushing this towards a more stable broad release:

::

   pip install https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/archive/refs/tags/v0.12.0a0.tar.gz

The documentation is still a work in progress, but there’s a reasonably
thorough demo of the main parts, and some basic API documentation for
the existing classes.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

Background and goals
--------------------

This work grew out of long-running efforts to refactor the seaborn
internals so that its functions could rely on common code-paths. At a
certain point, I realized that I was developing an API that might also
be interesting for external users.

Of course, “write a new interface” quickly turned into “rethink every
aspect of the library.” The current interface has some `pain
points <https://michaelwaskom.medium.com/three-common-seaborn-difficulties-10fdd0cc2a8b>`__
that arise from early constraints and path dependence. By starting
fresh, these can be avoided.

Originally, seaborn existed as a toolbox of domain-specific statistical
graphics to be used alongside matplotlib. As the library grew, it became
more common to reach for — or even learn — seaborn first. But one
inevitably desires some customization that is not offered within the
(already much-too-long) list of parameters in seaborn’s functions.
Currently, this necessitates direct use of matplotlib.

I’ve always thought that, if you’re comfortable with both libraries,
this setup offers a powerful blend of convenience and flexibility. But
it can be hard to know which library will let you accomplish some
specific task. And, as seaborn has become more powerful, one has to
write increasing amounts of matpotlib code to recreate what it is doing.

So the new interface is designed to provide a more comprehensive
experience, such that all of the steps involved in the creation of a
reasonably-customized plot can be accomplished in the same way. And the
compositional nature of the objects provides much more flexibility than
currently exists in seaborn with a similar level of abstraction that
lets you focus on *what* you want to show rather than *how* to show it.

One will note that the result looks a bit (a lot?) like ggplot. That’s
not unintentional, but the goal is also *not* to “port ggplot2 to
Python”. (If that’s what you’re looking for, check out the very nice
`plotnine <https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ package).
There is an immense amount of wisdom in the grammar of graphics and in
its particular implementation as ggplot2. But, as languages, R and
Python are just too different for idioms from one to feel natural when
translated literally into the other. So while I have taken much
inspiration from ggplot (along with vega-lite, d3, and other great
libraries), I’ve also made plenty of choices differently, for better or
for worse.
