v0.12.2 (December 2022)

This is an incremental release that is a recommended upgrade for all users. It is very likely the final release of the 0.12 series and the last version to support Python 3.7.

- |Feature| Added the :class:`objects.KDE` stat (:pr:`3111`).

- |Feature| Added the :class:`objects.Boolean` scale (:pr:`3205`).

- |Enhancement| Improved user feedback for failures during plot compilation by catching exceptions and re-raising with a `PlotSpecError` that provides additional context. (:pr:`3203`).

- |Fix| Improved calculation of automatic mark widths with unshared facet axes (:pr:`3119`).

- |Fix| Improved robustness to empty data in several components of the objects interface (:pr:`3202`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug where legends for numeric variables with large values would be incorrectly shown (i.e. with a missing offset or exponent; :pr:`3187`).

- |Fix| Fixed a regression in v0.12.0 where manually-added labels could have duplicate legend entries (:pr:`3116`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`histplot` with `kde=True` and `log_scale=True` where the curve was not scaled properly (:pr:`3173`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`relplot` where inner axis labels would be shown when axis sharing was disabled (:pr:`3180`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`objects.Continuous` to avoid an exception with boolean data (:pr:`3189`).
